# Form App - Directive 

Interactive form builder uses a directive to dynamically generate elements based on the user selection. 
Currently the HTML strings are hard-coded in the directive but they can be interactively, 
loaded from a folder.
LocalStorage is used to save the user selection.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
